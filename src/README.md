*	To install IntelliJ IDEA, you will need to go to the jetbrains website and download the ultimate edition. After downloading, install it to your computer and run it when itâ€™s done. Once running you will need to make an account and hopefully you have a way to get the ultimate for free, or else it will cost money after the free trial.
